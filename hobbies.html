          <p>Whitney's passion for Georgia Bulldogs football runs deep, and one of her favorite memories is attending the 2021 SEC Championship Game with her husband, a die-hard Alabama fan. The photo captures the two of them at the game, where Georgia unfortunately lost to Alabama in a hard-fought battle. Despite the defeat, Whitney's loyalty to the Bulldogs never wavered. Just a few months later, in January, Georgia had the ultimate redemption by defeating Alabama to claim the College Football Playoff National Championship. That victory was particularly sweet for Whitney, as it allowed her to share in the friendly rivalry with her husband while celebrating Georgia's long-awaited triumph.</p>

          <p>Whitney's love for travel is highlighted by one of her most memorable trips to Negril, Jamaica, in 2022, where she tied the knot surrounded by family and friends. The photo from this trip captures the excitement of the group as they made their way to Rick’s Café, a famous spot known for its stunning views, refreshing drinks, and adrenaline-pumping cliff diving. The trip was a perfect blend of adventure and celebration, with Whitney enjoying the company of her loved ones in one of the most beautiful tropical settings. From the crystal-clear waters to the thrill of cliff diving, Negril provided the perfect backdrop for unforgettable memories and the start of her new chapter.</p>
